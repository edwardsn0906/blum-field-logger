INSTRUCTIONS TO SAVE THE EDG LOGO:

1. Save the EDG logo image you uploaded as "logo.png" in this folder:
   C:\Users\noah.edwards\field_issue_logger\static\img\logo.png

2. The logo should be approximately 32px height for optimal display in the navigation bar.

3. If you can't save the uploaded image, I've created a CSS-based EDG logo as a backup.

The application is now configured to display your logo in the navigation bar once you save the file to the correct location.
