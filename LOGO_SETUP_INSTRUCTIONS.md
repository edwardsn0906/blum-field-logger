# EDG Logo Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. Right-click on the EDG logo image you uploaded in this chat
2. Save it as: `logo.png`
3. Place it in this exact folder: `C:\Users\noah.edwards\field_issue_logger\static\img\logo.png`

## Step 2: The code is already updated
The navigation bar code has been updated to use your logo image automatically once you save it to the correct location.

## Step 3: Verify the logo appears
1. Save the logo file to the location above
2. Restart your Flask app: `python app.py`
3. Refresh your browser
4. You should see your EDG logo next to "Field Issue Logger" in the navigation bar

## If you need help:
- Make sure the file is exactly named: `logo.png`
- Make sure it's in the exact folder: `static/img/`
- The logo will automatically resize to 32px height for optimal display
